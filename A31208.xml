            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>AS when wee have loſt the quiet of our Heart, we are to uſe all poſſible endeavours to recover it, <hi>(as is aforeſaid:)</hi> So thou muſt know <note place="margin">No acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, can juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of quiet.</note> that no accident whatſoever can with any juſt reaſon deprive us of the ſame.

                        <p>Thus conforming our ſelves to Gods holy Will, wee may quietly and peaceably paſſe through the midſt of all this lives bitterneſſes and contrarieties.

                        <p n="2">2.

Few are found free from it. 3. To avoid this ſnare we muſt ſeek Gods honour in all our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. 4.

To the ſame pertain <hi>Pride, Self-conceit. &amp;c.</hi> Which muſt be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died by the Practice of humility. 6. Alſo the <hi>paſſions of our inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our nature, Love, Hatred, &amp;c.</hi> To which we muſt oppoſe Peace of heart. 7. Laſtly, the <hi>adhering to our own wills and judgements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> which muſt be cured by Obedience. 8. Note a triple Obedience.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:58821:205"/> 2. <hi>Immoderate affection to creatures.</hi> 1. This diſtracts us from our Creator; againſt which we muſt provide Poverty of ſpirit. 2. <hi>Affections to perſons</hi> corrupt our judgements. 3. We muſt remedy it, by loving all impartially, <hi>in and for God.</hi> 4. <hi>Spirituall comforts</hi> may be ſometimes ſnares of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, therefore we muſt not ſtay in them, but tranſcend them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Extroverſion,</hi> or an inordinate application of our ſelves to externall things, 1. Which choakes up Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: therefore we muſt not thruſt our ſelves upon imployments, 2. But curb our fancies; 3. Perform works of obedience, neceſſity, and charity, without ingaging our affections; 4. And ſtrive to get into our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, 5. By fixing our heart on Chriſt crucified.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Bitterneſs of heart,</hi> ſadneſs, frowardneſſe, &amp;c. 2. All which proceed either from nature, indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thoughtfulneſſe, preſumption, or immortification; 3. And muſt be ſweetned with Charity. 4. To this belong a certain <hi>grudging at Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:58821:205"/> which muſt be avoided by a cordial Reſignation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Scrupuloſity,</hi> inward affliction, fearfulneſs, &amp;c. 1. Which aym at the deſtruction of our Faith and Confidence in God. 2. To avoid this, we muſt rely upon God and our guide, 3. And aſſure our ſelves that we cannot erre in Confidence, if we fall not into Negligence.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Exceſſive and unneceſſary ſtudy,</hi> 1. Which buſies the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but leaves the Will barren. 2. Puffs us up with Vanity, but leaves us empty of true Piety. 3. The remedy is to rectify our intentions in our ſtudies.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Tepidity and coldneſs in Devotion,</hi> 1. Which is the bane of all ſpirituality. We muſt alwayes go forward towards perfection, with perſeverance, and excite our ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſs with frequent aſpirations. 2. An excellent document of <hi>Saint Anthony.</hi>

                  <p>This (ſaith he) is that <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, holy and hidden Unitive vviſdom,</hi> which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any foregoing meditation, or precedent ſearch into divine myſteries, draws up forthwith the lovers affection to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Lord, which is more and more ſtretched, intended, and inlarged by theſe ardent eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations of the ſoul, thus fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly conferring, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, treating and talking with her Creator, and raiſing up her ſelf to him by acts of love, and deſires of conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. To curb our ſenſes from all curioſity, vanity, apprehenſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which may either defile our ſouls, or diſturb our minds, or diſtract our ſpirits; Either ſeduce us from the right way, or affright us when wee are in it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Then we muſt take <hi>Jeſus</hi> by

                        <p n="4">4. We muſt take our <hi>ſpirituall guide</hi> by the left hand, by punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all obedience.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. In our way, wee muſt have theſe or the like thoughts, recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, and devotions. <hi>Well,</hi> I am going to heaven; to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Creator; to my eternall reſt and Center; to ſee, love and praiſe my God for evermore: There only is true life, true love, true light, and true liberty: <hi>O Jeſu!</hi> how long! <hi>O Jeruſalem,</hi> when!</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Jeſus</hi> is with me, and for me, him I will follow, after him I will ſigh, and for him I will ſuffer, come what can. If I erre, let my <hi>guide</hi> look to it, for I am obedient; If I ſtumble, <hi>Jeſus</hi> will not let me fall, for I am faithfull.</p>
                        <p>If I cannot have the fruit of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> I will keep that of <hi>Obedience;</hi> What I cannot get by <hi>Recollection,</hi> I will procure by <hi>Reſignation;</hi>
                           <pb n="135" facs="tcp:58821:380"/> What I want by <hi>Indifferency,</hi> I will ſupply by <hi>Confidence;</hi> though my <hi>Deſerts</hi> fail, my <hi>Deſires</hi> ſhall prevail. What hath an end, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Live Eternity!</p>
                        <p>Sometimes let us hearken to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> ſpeaking. O my child, my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, my ſpouſe: <hi>What are all things to thee? follow thou me:</hi> Let all paſs, I am here: All is <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>One</hi> is all; trouble not thy ſelf with multiplicity. Be ſilent, and I will anſwer for thee; be content, I am thy ſufficiency; Be indifferent, all is my will; be confident, all is wel: I forgive thee all thou demandeſt; I will give thee all thou deſireſt; I will never deſert thee, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw my eys, hand, heart, from thee; therefore goe on quietly, couragiouſly, confidently.</p>
                        <p>Other times let us anſwer him meekly and faithfully: <hi>O good Jeſu!</hi> ſave me, for I am thine; <hi>O ſweet Saviour,</hi> ſupport me, for I am weak; <hi>O loving guide,</hi> direct me, for I am blind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus boldly let us keep on our way, 1. Letting paſſe all, by inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58821:381"/> 2. Out-paſſing all, by fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. 3. Paſſing under all, by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. 4. Paſſing over all, by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity and elevation of ſpirit.</p>

This is cured by not caring what hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour we are in, but to endeavour with courage and confidence to pleaſe God, whether we are ſad or merry, fervent or deſolate; making uſe of Prayer and Counſell. 4. <hi>An indiſcreet</hi> and prepoſterous <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our bodies.</hi> The way to cure this is to follow the rules of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and to find out their own ſtrength and complexion; yet ſtill taking heed of the contrary extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, of flattering our ſenſuality under pretence of ſpirituality. 5. <hi>The keeping company with ſcrupulous perſons,</hi> or miſunderſtanding ſome Spirituall <hi>Books.</hi> Remedy this by ſhunning ſuch Company, laying aſide ſuch Books, and obtaining from your Director, a Rule to rely upon, and beleeving nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that. 6.
